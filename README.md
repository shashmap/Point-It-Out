 "point-it-out"

If pointers confuse you, this repo points it all out.

This repository is a collection of simple and clear programs that demonstrate how pointers work in **C** and **C++**.  
Each example focuses on a single concept and includes comments to make the logic easy to understand.  
Whether you're a beginner or revising for interviews, this repo is built to make pointer concepts easier to grasp.

 What's this project about?

- To learn and practice pointers in C and C++
- To share beginner-friendly, readable code examples
- To stay consistent and build a daily GitHub commit streak
- To help other learners with real, working code and explanations


Topics Covered

➤ In C
Pointers and addresses

-Pointer arithmetic

-Pointers vs arrays

-Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, calloc, free)

-Function pointers

➤ In C++

-new and delete

-Smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr)

About This Repo:

This is part of my learning journey to become better at C/C++ and understand low-level programming concepts.
I use this project to explore, learn, and stay consistent by committing regularly.
Each program is written in a simple, well-structured way with comments to explain what's happening, one concept at a time.
From basic pointer operations to more advanced memory handling, everything is organized for clarity and hands-on learning.
It’s designed to support consistent learning and serve as a helpful reference for anyone exploring pointers.
If this helps you or you have suggestions, feel free to contribute!
